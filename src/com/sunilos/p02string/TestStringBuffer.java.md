### Explanation:
- **`StringBuffer`**: A mutable sequence of characters, useful when you need to modify a string multiple times (e.g., using `append()`).
- **`append()`**: Adds the specified string to the end of the `StringBuffer` content.
- **`Date(long date)`**: Constructs a `Date` object based on the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 (epoch). Here, it's calculated as 15 minutes in milliseconds.
