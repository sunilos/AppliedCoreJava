### Explanation:

- **Class Documentation**: Provides an overview of the `Counter` class, explaining that it demonstrates the use of static methods and variables to manage a sequence of numbers.

- **Static Variable Documentation**: Describes the purpose and behavior of the static variable `count`, highlighting that it maintains its value across method calls and is shared among all instances of the class.

- **Static Method Documentation**: Explains what the `nextNumber()` method doesâ€”incrementing the static `count` variable and returning the next number in the sequence.

- **Main Method Documentation**: Describes the purpose of the `main` method, which demonstrates how to use the `nextNumber()` method to print a sequence of numbers.

- **Expected Output Documentation**: Shows what output to expect when the `main` method is run, illustrating the result of calling `nextNumber()` repeatedly.
