### Explanation:

- **Purpose:** The `PragramaticExceptions` class demonstrates how to programmatically throw an exception based on a conditionâ€”in this case, user validation.

- **isValidUser Method:** 
  - This method simulates the validation of a user. It always returns `false`, indicating that the user is invalid. This setup is specifically designed to trigger an exception.

- **Main Method:**
  - The main method first calls `isValidUser()` to check if the user is valid.
  - If `userFound` is `true`, it prints "Valid User". However, since the method always returns `false`, this block will not execute.
  - If `userFound` is `false`, the program creates a new `RuntimeException` with the message "Invalid User" and throws it. This action signals that an invalid user has been encountered.

- **Exception Handling:** 
  - This class demonstrates the concept of throwing exceptions programmatically, which can be caught and handled by a higher-level exception handler, enabling structured error management in a larger application.
