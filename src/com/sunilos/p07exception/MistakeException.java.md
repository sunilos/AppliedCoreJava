### Explanation:

- **Purpose:** The `MistakeException` class defines a custom checked exception that indicates an error or mistake has occurred within the application. It provides a specific error message to clarify the nature of the exception.

- **Inheritance:** By extending `Exception`, this class becomes a checked exception. This requires that any method that throws this exception must declare it in its `throws` clause, and the caller must handle it appropriately.

- **Constructor:**
  - The default constructor (`MistakeException()`) initializes the exception with a specific message: "I made a mistake". This message is passed to the superclass (`Exception`) constructor, which allows it to be retrieved later when the exception is caught.

- **Usage:** This exception can be thrown in various scenarios where a mistake needs to be explicitly communicated. It provides a clear and descriptive way to signal errors, making error handling more understandable and relevant within the application's context. Using a specific exception like `MistakeException` helps clarify the cause of the error when handling exceptions.
