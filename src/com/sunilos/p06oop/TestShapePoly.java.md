### Explanation:

- **Purpose:** The `TestShapePoly` class is designed to demonstrate polymorphism in Java by calculating the total area of different shapes (Rectangle, Circle, Triangle) using the overridden `area()` method in each shape class.

- **Array of Shape References:** An array `s` of type `Shape` is created to hold references to different shape objects. This allows the program to treat different shapes uniformly while utilizing their specific implementations.

- **Object Assignment:** Specific shape objects (`Rectangle`, `Circle`, and `Triangle`) are instantiated and assigned to the elements of the `Shape` array.

- **Calculating Total Area:** The `calcArea` method is called, which takes the `Shape` array as an argument. This method iterates through the array and calls the `area()` method for each shape, summing their areas to compute the total.

- **Returning Total Area:** The calculated total area is returned from the `calcArea` method and printed in the `main` method, showcasing how polymorphism allows for dynamic method invocation based on the actual object type at runtime.
