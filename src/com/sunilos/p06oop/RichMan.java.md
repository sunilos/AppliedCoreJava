### Explanation:

- **Interface:** `RichMan` is an interface that defines a set of behaviors (methods) without providing any implementation. Any class that implements this interface must define concrete implementations for all the declared methods.
- **Method Declarations:** The methods `earnMony()`, `donation()`, and `party()` are abstract method declarations. There is no code body, and the implementing class will provide the behavior for these methods.
- **Typo:** There appears to be a typo in the method name `earnMony()`; it is likely intended to be `earnMoney()`.
