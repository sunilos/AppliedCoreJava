### Explanation:

- **Abstract Class:** `Shape` is an abstract class, meaning it cannot be instantiated directly. It serves as a base class for other specific shape classes (e.g., `Rectangle`, `Circle`) that will implement the abstract method `area()`.
  
- **Attributes:** 
  - `color` (type `String`): Represents the color of the shape.
  - `borderWidth` (type `int`): Represents the width of the shape's border.
  These attributes are marked as `protected`, meaning they can be accessed by subclasses directly.

- **Constructors:** 
  - The default constructor allows creating a `Shape` object without any initial values.
  - The parameterized constructor initializes the shape with a specific color and border width.

- **Getter and Setter Methods:** These methods provide controlled access to the `color` and `borderWidth` attributes, allowing values to be retrieved and modified.

- **Abstract Method `area()`:** This method is declared as `abstract`, meaning that its implementation will be provided by the child classes of `Shape`. Each subclass will define how to calculate the area based on its specific shape type (e.g., rectangle, circle).
