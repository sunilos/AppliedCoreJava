### Explanation:
- This class is a fully encapsulated Account class, defining various properties and methods for a bank account.
- It contains fields for account number, type, and balance, along with getter and setter methods for these fields.
- It provides methods for depositing and withdrawing amounts, which update the balance accordingly.
- There is also a method for fund transfer, but its implementation is yet to be completed.
