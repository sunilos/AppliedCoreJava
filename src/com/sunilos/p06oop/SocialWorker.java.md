### Explanation:

- **Interface:** `SocialWorker` is an interface that specifies a set of behaviors (methods) for social worker-related classes. Interfaces do not provide implementations; they only declare methods.
  
- **Method Declaration:** The method `helpToOthers()` is an abstract method that must be implemented by any class that implements the `SocialWorker` interface. This method defines the expected behavior of how a social worker assists others, but the actual implementation will depend on the specific class that implements the interface.
