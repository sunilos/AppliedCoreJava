### Explanation of Key Points:
- **Non-cloneable Class**: The `CustomerAddress` class does not implement the `Cloneable` interface. As a result, instances of this class cannot be cloned, which means that any references to `CustomerAddress` will be shared among different `Customer` instances.
- **Public Fields**: The fields (`street`, `city`, and `pin`) are declared as public, allowing direct access from outside the class. This approach simplifies access but can lead to issues with encapsulation if not managed carefully.
- **Field Purpose**: Each field has a specific purpose: `street` stores the street name, `city` stores the city name, and `pin` stores the postal code. This structure allows the `CustomerAddress` class to encapsulate relevant address information in a single object.
