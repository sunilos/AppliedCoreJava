### Explanation of Key Parts:

- **BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream**: These classes provide buffering, which can improve I/O performance by reducing the number of disk access operations. Data is read and written in larger chunks rather than one byte at a time.
- **Byte Array Buffer**: A byte array (`buff`) is used to read and write data in chunks of 256 bytes. This is more efficient than reading and writing one byte at a time.
- **Reading and Writing Chunks**: The loop continues until no more bytes are read (i.e., `count` becomes 0). The `write` method writes the specified number of bytes from the buffer to the target file.
- **Resource Management**: As in the previous example, it's important to close the streams to free system resources.
