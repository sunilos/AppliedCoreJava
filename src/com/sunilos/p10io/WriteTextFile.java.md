### Explanation of Key Parts:

- **FileWriter**: This class is used for writing character files. It allows writing data in character format to a specified file.
- **Writing Data**:
  - The `write(char[])` method writes the contents of the character array to the file.
  - The `write(char)` method writes a single character to the file.
  - The `write(String)` method writes a string to the file.
- **File Creation**: If the specified file (`test1.txt`) does not exist, `FileWriter` will create it. If it does exist, the existing file will be overwritten.
- **Closing the Writer**: Itâ€™s important to call `close()` on the `FileWriter` to free up system resources and ensure all data is properly written to the file.
