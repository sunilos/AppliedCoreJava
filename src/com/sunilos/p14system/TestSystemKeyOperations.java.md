### Explanation:
- **Garbage Collector**:
  - `System.gc()` suggests that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) perform garbage collection, which is the process of reclaiming memory used by objects that are no longer reachable. It's important to note that calling `gc()` does not guarantee immediate execution of the garbage collector.

- **Mapping Library Names**:
  - `System.mapLibraryName("os.name")` returns the name of the library that corresponds to the specified library name, adjusted for the current operating system. In this case, it might return a system-specific name for a library related to the operating system.

- **Finalization**:
  - `System.runFinalization()` forces the finalization of objects that are pending finalization. This is usually done when an objectâ€™s `finalize()` method has not yet been called but is marked for garbage collection.

- **Terminating the JVM**:
  - `System.exit(1)` terminates the JVM. The argument `1` typically indicates abnormal termination (you might use `0` for normal termination). Once this method is called, the JVM stops, and any code after this line will not execute, which is why the subsequent print statement will not appear.

This program showcases essential system operations available through the `System` class in Java, especially in resource management and JVM control.
